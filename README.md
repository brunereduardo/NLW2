## Project description
<p align="justify">During Next Level Week I studied several technologies totally focused on responsive web application (mobile first) such as HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript (+ JSON), SQlite (very interesting to learn another DB, different from what we have contact in college) and finally NodeJs with its modules such as: Nodemon (utility that monitors any changes in your source code and automatically restarts your server) and Nunjucks (template engine).
I want to leave my thanks to the Rocketseat instructors for this immense week in content, but that through the mentoring teaching methods made it easy to learn various technologies in 7 days.</p>
